Design
Multi-threaded programming is implemented using pthreads library present in C language. For large input files executing grep command takes a considerable amount of time when compared to multi-threaded programming. Threads allow multiple lines of flow which makes parallel implementation possible. The execution time greatly reduces if we process the input using a certain number of threads.

However, there is no specific number of threads we can implement that works best for each program input. In general, more threads are required for larger files compared to small sized input files. I have split the input text file in the form of multiple chunks of lines where each chunk (set of lines) are assigned for each thread that I have created to simulate grep command. I have got the total count of lines present in the input file by counting the ââ                                          hreads to be created is not explicitly given, I am setting it to total lines divided by chunk size. I have tried chunk sizes of 2000, 1000 and 50 for first 40000 lines of Sherlock book using the "and" word as my search string for grep command and my code worked best for chunk size of 50 for the above mentioned input papremeters. Below I have included the running times of the program in milli seconds.
Using built-in grep command - 61 
Implementing pargrep by not specifying no.of threads - 53
The below format is observed by specifying no.of threads in input
#Threads	 Execution time in milliseconds
1       		51
10      		52
100     		53
200     		54
400     		56
600     		54
800     		41
1000    		49
1200            	60
1400    		61
1600    		65
1800    		71
2000    		76
The thread implementation of grep provided better results incase of the run time, but it does not hold true for all the thread numbers. I have observed that upon increasing thread limit till a certain extend, there was an increase in performance. After this extend, the execution till increases extremely high compared to the original grep since the overhead of thread creation is far heavier than executing the grep command on the input lines. This chunk size also must vary depending on the file input size and particular word that is searched to get maximum efficiency.
